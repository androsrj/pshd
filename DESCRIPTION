Description: Penalized structural Hamming distance (PSHD) is an extension of the more traditional 
structural Hamming distance which quanitifes the distance between DAG structures in their adjacency 
matrix form. PSHD allows the user to incorporate different penalty parameters when summing the edge 
disagreements. For instance, a penalty higher than 1 could be assigned when network A contains an 
edge which network B does not, and a penalty of less than 1 could be assigned when network B 
contains an edge not contained in network A.
